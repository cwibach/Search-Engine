# Search-Engine
A Search Engine designed and tested with LAtimes data from 1989 and 1990, includes BM25, Cosine Similarity, and Boolean AND Search. Can evaluate TREC search results with Precision, Average Precision, and NDCG.
Originally created for a class, it was improved to fix all errors identified throughout, as well as to add the option of stemming for all searches and to allow command line searching for all search methods.
